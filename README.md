1. `a`: This CSS selector targets all `<a>` (anchor) elements and removes the underline from the links.

   - `text-decoration: none;`: Removes the default underline from links.

2. `a:visited`: This CSS selector targets visited `<a>` elements and changes their text color to black.

   - `color: black;`: Sets the text color to black for visited links.

The HTML document contains two hyperlinks with different destinations. The CSS styles are applied to control the appearance of the links, removing underlines and changing the color of visited links to black. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
